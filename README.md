ft_irc

ft_irc is a network programming project that focuses on building a real-time communication server inspired by the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol.
The project aims to provide a deep understanding of how networked applications operate, from client connections to message exchange and multi-user interaction.

Through ft_irc, students explore the fundamentals of TCP/IP networking, client–server architecture, and concurrent communication. The project emphasizes managing multiple clients simultaneously, maintaining consistent server state, and ensuring reliable message delivery in a real-time environment.

Beyond networking itself, ft_irc highlights key system-level concepts such as event-driven programming, resource management, and robust error handling. It requires designing a scalable and resilient server capable of handling asynchronous input while remaining stable under load and unexpected client behavior.
